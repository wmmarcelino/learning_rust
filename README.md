## About

This repository contains Rust codes to practice the concepts of ownership, movement and borrowing, as well as using the main crates used in Rust development.

## Code organization

The codes are organized by folders. This means that each folder, which might has one or more files, corresponds to its implementation.

- `single_linked_list`
- `toml_reader`
- `xml_reader`
- `json_reader`

## Contribution

If you find any problem or have suggestions, feel free to open a issue ou contribute with a pull request!
