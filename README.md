## About

In this repository are the Rust codes implementing the most basic data structures to exercise the concepts of ownership, movement and borrowing.

## Code organization

The data structure codes are organized by folders. This means that each folder, which might has one or more files, corresponds to the implementation of a data structure.

- `01-single_linked_list/`: Simply linked list
